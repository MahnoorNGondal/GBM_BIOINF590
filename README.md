Glioblastoma is an incurable and poorly understood tumor, with diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental factors contributing to its progression. However, their precise characterization remains a challenge. The molecular characteristics of glioblastoma are unique and the cancer can be divided into three subtypes. The disambiguation of these subtypes is difficult with only bulk data. An approach using single cell technology allows us to better understand cellular heterogeneity within an individual at the single cell level. However, as single cell data can be expensive to generate and usually contains fewer samples, it is necessary to bridge the gap between single cell and bulk data to classify glioblastoma patients more accurately when analyzing bulk data.

In this study, we develop a unified model of glioblastoma cell states and genetic diversity using single-cell RNA-sequencing as well as bulk genetic expression analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As glioblastoma has four subtypes, this study identifies the malignant cells within the three subtypes and makes use of TCGA data on these subtypes towards identifying putative biomarkers its treatment. Our goal is to analyze the single cell data to find features that can be mapped back to bulk data for glioblastoma robust classification.
